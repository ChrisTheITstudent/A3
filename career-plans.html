        <div class="personality per-chris">
          <h3>Chris</h3>
          <p>Chris identified Software Engineer as his ideal job. In the Burning Glass Institute (2018c) data provided, this job title ranked 12th in terms of demand from 539 job postings. Although no mention of skills specific to the use of Azure or web framework, data was shown that ranked hypertext preprocessor/PHP skills at number 12 in the most demanded skills from employers (Burning Glass Institute, 2018a). Generally, IT experience ranked 73rd in the most demanded skills and leadership ranked 12th (Burning Glass Institute, 2018b).</p>
          <p>After analysing the data provided, Chris is still interested in a career as a Software Engineer but now also has an equal interest in a career as a Front End Developer. This is because Javascript ranked higher and from further research on Seek (n.d.,) Chris found there are 3835 job advertisements posted as of the access date. This indicated to Chris that the industry has a high need for the position of Front End Developer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="personality per-jen">
          <h3>Jen</h3>
          <p>Jen identified a Software Developer role for her ideal job.  Of the top IT Job titles reported within the Burning Glass dataset (2018b), Software Developers ranked 19th out of the 200 roles assessed.  C# was the highest ranked skill required for the Software Developer role, ranking 6th out of the 200 skills assessed.  Git ranked 11th and Microsoft Visual Studio skills ranked 43rd.</p>
          <p>Jen’s review of industry data provided her with an understanding that this is not the role for her. Alternatively, she plans  to continue with her Project/Program Management career and employ the skills she gains through her IT studies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="personality per-andy">
          <h3>Andy</h3>
          <p>Andy identified Data Warehouse Manager as his ideal job. Within the Burning Glass data, this job title does not appear, however ‘Data Warehouse Developer’ does. This job is not highly ranked at #192 (2018c), however could be an entry level into a data warehouse environment.</p>
          <p>Andy’s in-demand skills do not have Azure specifically referenced however skills such as ASP (30) is a framework to work with Azure. Linux is listed as the 10th most in demand with the top IT skills which are not in the required skill being SQL 1st, Javascript 2nd and Java 4th. Review of the Burning Glass data made Andy realise this is not a highly sought-after role. This doesn’t change the appeal of the job, however, it does focus Andy's attention on other career opportunities through IT management.</p>

          <h2>Comparison and Reflection</h2>
          <p>There were few similarities between the original ideal jobs and required skills listed among the group.  The only common technical skill identified was Azure, with general experience listed as the only common non-technical requirement.</p>
