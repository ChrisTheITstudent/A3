        <p>This project will create a way to transform for the better the way in which educators throughout Australia can approach one aspect of quality care. Australia introduced the National Quality Framework (NQF)  on 1 January, 2012 (ACEQA, n.d.-a). This introduced a framework for education professionals in the early childhood education and care sector to use and work with in order to meet the best quality care and interests of children. </p>
        <p>With the introduction of the framework, a process of assessment and rating was also introduced along with National Quality Standards. One area of these standards were Staffing arrangements (ACEQA, n.d.-a). As part of this process, early childhood education centres are required to produced evidence of their continual meeting and improving upon these standards as part of a Quality Improvement Plan (ACEQA, n.d.-c).
          The project is a web interface that educators in the early childhood care and education industry can use in order to calculate, communicate, record and view child to educator ratios in order to assist educators to better meet the legislative and quality care requirements (Queensland Government, 2021). This project will keep information relating to the current occupancy for the service and educators currently available. It will then use a ratio formula to calculate how many groups of children, what ages the children in each group are and how many staff are required for each group. This data is then stored and made accessible when needed.</p>

          <h2>Motivation</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The motivation for this project is to enhance the quality of care that educators can provide for children in the early childhood education and care environment. When drawing from the team’s experience in early childhood, security, data base and networking and the personal passions the team shares for making a difference through this project, the team is motivated to make a change in the industry and using the trends of the integration of the IoT (Internet of Thing) in early childhood (Insider Intelligence, 2022). A study by Rogers (2021) looked at the stress levels of educators within the sector and discovered that the feeling of being micromanaged rated highly among the reasons why educators felt stressed in the workplace.</p>
        <div class="quote">
          <p>“This study revealed 63% of educators felt micromanaged by their supervisors in the last week, while over 78% felt micromanaged by government requirements and documents which make up these managerial systems.”</p>
          <p>(Rogers, 2021)</p>
        </div>
        <p>Early childhood educators are required to document practices to meet regulatory guidelines and National Quality Standards quality care indicators during the assessment and rating process (ACEQA, n.d.-a). This leads to additional paperwork and has led to less time that educators have to engage in meaningful play experiences with children (Kelly, 2016).</p>
        <div class="quote">
          <p>“From policies and procedures, planning, observations, risk assessments, forms, daily record sheets, supervisions, appraisals and learning journeys it leaves less and less time for practitioners to engage in meaningful play experiences with the children.”</p>
          <p>(Kelly, 2016)</p>
        </div>
        <p>It is with this motivation that the team is designing this project to enhance the early childhood industry through a safe, secure and easy to use app that monitors staffing arrangements and educator to child ratios.</p>

          <p>When a Google search was done, one result was for <a href="https://www.procaresoftware.com">Procare Software</a>. This software is a combination of customer relationships management, lead management and compliance management software. Procare Software doesn’t quote a price on the use of the product, however it does state that one price includes all the children in the service (Procare Software, n.d.). This appears to be the leading competition for the project. A point of difference would be the transparency and ease of use of the app that the project plans to make. The app the team plans to make will be a simple, yet secure app that is easy to set up and able to be set up by a director/manager and that the director/manager is able to administrate themselves with clear, quick and easy setup steps. The project also aims to keep the costs of this app low. This is possibly another point which can bring a competitive edge to the project over Procare Software.</p>
          <p>A range of other websites do appear when searching for a ratio calculator, however, they generally point to ACECQA. ACECQA (2022) provides a simple online tool to assist in determining child to educator ratios.  The calculator considers the location of the service provider (state) and the number of children in each age bracket to determine the minimum number of educators required.  However, this project differs in that it also provides the ability to communicate, record and view ratios.</p>
          <p>Additional research for like products was completed through accessing the Department of Education’s list of registered Child Care Subsidy software (2022). Many of the products lists, such as QIKKIDS and Spike, allow for ratios to be set for each room, however, in a simplistic manner used for staff rostering purposes only:  </p>
          <p>The Smart Central Child Care Management System (2022) does provide the ability to calculate live ratios across rooms and includes the ability to handle mixed age calculations: <a href="https://www.smartcentral.com.au/smartstaff">SmartStaff</a> </p>
          <p>Another one - Prime childcare software starts at $99 per month and has a live headcount display: <a href="https://pccsoft.com/meeting-quality-standards-with-optimum-classroom-ratios/">Prime Childcare Software</a></p>
