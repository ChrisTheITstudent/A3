        <p>This project will create a way to transform for the better the way in which educators throughout Australia can approach one aspect of quality care. Australia introduced the National Quality Framework (NQF)  on 1 January, 2012 (ACEQA, n.d.-a). This introduced a framework for education professionals in the early childhood education and care sector to use and work with in order to meet the best quality care and interests of children. </p>
        <p>With the introduction of the framework, a process of assessment and rating was also introduced along with National Quality Standards. One area of these standards were Staffing arrangements (ACEQA, n.d.-a). As part of this process, early childhood education centres are required to produced evidence of their continual meeting and improving upon these standards as part of a Quality Improvement Plan (ACEQA, n.d.-c).
          The project is a web interface that educators in the early childhood care and education industry can use in order to calculate, communicate, record and view child to educator ratios in order to assist educators to better meet the legislative and quality care requirements (Queensland Government, 2021). This project will keep information relating to the current occupancy for the service and educators currently available. It will then use a ratio formula to calculate how many groups of children, what ages the children in each group are and how many staff are required for each group. This data is then stored and made accessible when needed.</p>

        <p>The motivation for this project is to enhance the quality of care that educators can provide for children in the early childhood education and care environment. When drawing from the teamâ€™s experience in early childhood, security, data base and networking and the personal passions the team shares for making a difference through this project, the team is motivated to make a change in the industry and using the trends of the integration of the IoT (Internet of Thing) in early childhood (Insider Intelligence, 2022). A study by Rogers (2021) looked at the stress levels of educators within the sector and discovered that the feeling of being micromanaged rated highly among the reasons why educators felt stressed in the workplace.</p>
