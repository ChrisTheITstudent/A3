        <p>Team Focus used a variety of tools and technologies to coordinate this assessment. Weekly meetings and chat occurred through Microsoft Teams and draft documents were maintained through Teams,  including previous content and agendas.  Three of the tools used were also able to link to Teams.   These included Wrike, PowerApps Studio, Canva and Lucidchart.</p>
        <p>Wrike allowed the team to manage tasks independently and to manage the overall project, with both a task view and timeline provided.  Lucidchart was used to develop the database design and PowerApps Studio to develop the application itself, with databases hosted through Dataverse and lists stored in SharePoint. </p>
        <p>Canva was used to generate the report document and Atom used in conjunction with GitHub desktop to update the website content.</p>
