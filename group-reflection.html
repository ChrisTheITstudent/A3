        <p>The development of the project idea and the research around it brought the team to develop a set of goals or steps to required be taken along the way. This was also done by Team Focus with the project development as part of the assessment. Using Wrike for this helped define the steps and draft delegation of tasks which would be needed to complete each task. Team Focus found this useful as they were able to mark tasks as complete and see in brief the tasks to still be completed. This helped with time management within the team. The group also had updates via teams and diary entries. This meant lots of different spaces to track tasks. </p>
        <p>Reflecting on this, the team’s view is that a single point may have assisted in collating documents, ideas, and artifacts. However, these were still able to be collated with a final document made in Canva. Draft ideas and task updates were posted to MS Teams which allowed the team to view, review and comment as each team member completed work. This helped the team meet deadlines and work collaboratively as it gave the entire team a view as well as regular updates on the progress of individual tasks. </p>
        <p>The team met regularly through a recorded video meeting which gave Team Focus an opportunity to review the status of tasks, brainstorm ideas to complete future tasks, assign tasks that have yet to be assigned and prioritize work.</p>
        <p>Team Focus regularly checked on the mindset of each team member and this led to a collective and collaborative project. Each team member had valuable skills and interests which the team did their best to incorporate into the final project. Exploring analytics was one part which the team feels they may have struggled with. The software and programs that were used showed what work was done but there was no single point that could show accurately contributions from each team member individually. If the team worked again in the future, the team would like to explore the use of a more versatile program or software that could accurately record contributions both from the technical aspect and the academic aspect. One point which the team seemed to collectively hold is motivation and enthusiasm for the project as well as the development of the application both academically and technically. The team feels that this is a strong point in the success of this project. </p>

            <p>Assessment Three was a mammoth task and never seemed to end.  Given we are a small team, I am happy with what we managed to accomplish and feel we have delivered an excellent submission.  Communication was effective and our overall team dynamic a welcome change from Assessment Two.</p>
            <p>Clear definition of roles and responsibilities wasn't really determined and evolved organically based on our experiences.  I wanted to contribute more of the technical component of the assignment over content development for the report, so decided to start work on developing a Chatbot, which I enjoyed although I didn’t get very far.</p>
            <p>What surprised me most was how easy it is to learn to use a lot of the new technologies I have been exposed to.  As OUA students, it is easy to communicate amongst the team given the tools we have available to us, however, we all have different hours, weeks and days allocated for our university work and this can sometimes create lags.  Overall, I feel our team worked well together an I’m grateful to my team mates for their contributions….but glad it’s over now!</p>

            <p>This project brought me on a journey to develop an application I am passionate about. Although I was passionate, I took feedback from last assessment and attempted to make sure everyone had a role to play, and tasks were delegated more evenly. This worked well for me as it allowed me to explore the skills of the team more and discover new ways of doing this which enhanced my learning throughout the project. At the beginning of the project, task management was a point which the team in the previous project agreed could be improved. This prompted me to explore the use of software that could track project management and tasks. The software that was used allowed tasks to be added, delegated, and checked off when complete. This worked well as it allowed input from the team as a whole and for the team to feel a sense of working collaboratively. </p>
            <p>An aspect I struggled with was the use of PowerApps. This was a learning curve for me and although the development of an interface and the front end was easy for me, I struggled developing a backend to the application through the features provided. I learnt the majority of what I needed to know to complete the tasks that contributed to the team and feel this may be something I would invest further learning in.</p>
