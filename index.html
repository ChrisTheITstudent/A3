          <h2>Group Processes</h2>
            <p>The team has changed since Assessment Two.  Now down to three people, some new processes and tools have been implemented owing to lessons learnt. </p>
            <p>The team now meets via video conference weekly through Microsoft  Teams, given they are geographically dispersed.  Team members previously met twice weekly but this is no longer required.  Communication is now maintained continuously through Teams chat as well as task submission and review using Wrike.</p>
            <p>Team members are able to complete their allocated tasks at a time of their choosing and to submit for review or comment as each is completed, preventing a last-minute rush to finalise submission of the assessment. There have been no issues throughout Assessment Three in maintaining communication, however, team members would not hesitate to contact staff if issues occurred and could not be rectified independently.</p>
            <p>The draft report for Assessment Three was commenced immediately, with existing content moved to a new document.  A Canva template was developed and added to incrementally as tasks were completed and content developed, which will assist in  submission of  a polished and cohesive product. </p>
