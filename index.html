          <h2>Group Processes</h2>
            <p>The team has changed since Assessment Two.  Now down to three people, some new processes and tools have been implemented owing to lessons learnt. </p>
            <p>The team now meets via video conference weekly through Microsoft  Teams, given they are geographically dispersed.  Team members previously met twice weekly but this is no longer required.  Communication is now maintained continuously through Teams chat as well as task submission and review using Wrike.</p>
            <p>Team members are able to complete their allocated tasks at a time of their choosing and to submit for review or comment as each is completed, preventing a last-minute rush to finalise submission of the assessment. There have been no issues throughout Assessment Three in maintaining communication, however, team members would not hesitate to contact staff if issues occurred and could not be rectified independently.</p>
            <p>The draft report for Assessment Three was commenced immediately, with existing content moved to a new document.  A Canva template was developed and added to incrementally as tasks were completed and content developed, which will assist in  submission of  a polished and cohesive product. </p>

          <h2>Career Plans</h2>
            <h3>Andy</h3>
            <p>Andy identified Data Warehouse Manager as his ideal job. Within the Burning Glass data, this job title does not appear, however ‘Data Warehouse Developer’ does. This job is not highly ranked at #192, however could be an entry level into a data warehouse environment.

Andy’s in-demand skills do not have Azure specifically referenced however skills such as ASP (30) is framework to work with Azure. Linux is listed as 10th in demand skill. The top IT skills which are not in the require skill set are SQL 1st, Javascript 2nd and Java 4th. Writing, communication and problem-solving skills are not specifically referenced in Andy’s required skill sets for this role, however would be highly advantageous.

Review of the Burning Glass data made Andy realise this is not a highly sought-after role. This doesn’t change the appeal of the ideal job however it does focus his attention on other career opportunities through IT management. </p>
            <h3>Jennifer</h3>
            <p>Jennifer identified a Software Developer role for her ideal job.  Jennifer’s review of industry data provided her with an understanding that this is not the role for her. Alternatively, Jennifer will continue with her Project/Program Management career and employ the skills she gains through her IT studies.  Of the top IT Job titles reported within the Burning Glass dataset (Burning Glass Institute, 2018b), Software Developers ranked 19th out of the 200 roles assessed.  C# was the highest ranked skill required for the Software Developer role, ranking 6th out of the 200 skills assessed.  Git ranked 11th and Microsoft Visual Studio skills ranked 43rd. Generalist skills were not referred to in the job advertisement, however requirements would likely include experience in working within a project team and high-level communication skills. </p>
            <h3>Christopher</h3>
            <p>Christopher identified Software Engineer as his ideal job. In the Burning Glass Institute (2018c) data provided, this job title ranked 12th with 539 job postings. Although no mention of skills specific to the use of Azure or web framework, data was shown that ranked hypertext pre-processor/PHP skills at number 12 in the most demanded skills from employers (Burning Glass Institute, 2018a). Generally, IT experience ranked 73rd in the most demanded skills and leadership ranked 12th (Burning Glass Institute, 2018b). </p>
            <p>After analysing the data provided, Christopher is still interested in a career as a software engineer but also now has an equal interest in a career as a front-end developer. This is because the skill ranking of JavaScript ranked higher and from further research on Seek (nd) found there are 3835 job advertisements posted as of the access date. This indicated to Christopher that the industry has a high need for the skills required for the position of front-end developer. </p>
