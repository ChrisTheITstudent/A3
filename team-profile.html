          <h2>Christopher</h2>
          <p>Chris’s results reveal him as a protagonist. The highest scores were for the feeling and extroverted categories. When Christopher took the Educational Planner Learning Test, his highest result (55%) showed that he is a tactile learner. This means that the easiest way for Christopher to learn something is by doing it. The results from the Favourite Types of Work test that Christopher took showed a result that favours investigative work. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="personality per-jen">
          <h2>Jennifer</h2>
          <p>Jennifer is introverted though assertive, efficient, and practical. The results also show that she values order and prefers to work alone. The test also assessed Jennifer as ‘feeling’ in nature, meaning she is empathetic and prioritises cooperation. Jennifer is assessed as having a ‘gold’ personality. Jennifer is dependable, prepared, organised, and caring. The results also show she believes there is always a right and wrong way to do things and that she is a rule-follower. The PLP profile summary pointed out Jennifer’s strengths align to academic drive and accessing support. Personal value was also highlighted as a focus area.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="personality per-andy">
          <h2>Andy</h2>
          <p>Andy displays qualities of kindness and is a true altruist. The results showed Andy has strength in humility which should support working in a team. Andy was given a label of extroversion which indicates outgoing and social. The second factor supported emotion stability. Andy was given a reflector style match which interestingly is a ‘stand back’ approach and in contradiction to the outgoing social nature of test 2.</p>

          <h2>What does this mean for Team Focus?</h2>
          <p>The personality profiles show a few commonalities. For the Myers-Briggs test, Andy and Jen are both assessed as Defenders, within the Sentinel personality  group, with Chris a Protagonist within the Diplomat group.   All three  personality types share characteristics of enthusiasm and are hardworking, with deadlines likely to be achieved. All three team members are also thoughtful and caring.</p>
          <p>The main differences are evident for learning style, with Chris a tactile learner, Jen preferring to work independently and Andy preferring to analyse data first. </p>

              <h3>Jennifer</h3>
              <p>Jen identified a Software Developer role for her ideal job.  Of the top IT Job titles reported within the Burning Glass dataset (2018b), Software Developers ranked 19th out of the 200 roles assessed.  C# was the highest ranked skill required for the Software Developer role, ranking 6th out of the 200 skills assessed.  Git ranked 11th and Microsoft Visual Studio skills ranked 43rd.</p>
              <p>Jen’s review of industry data provided her with an understanding that this is not the role for her. Alternatively, she plans  to continue with her Project/Program Management career and employ the skills she gains through her IT studies.</p>

            <div class="career-plans-chris">
              <h3>Christopher</h3>
              <p>Chris identified Software Engineer as his ideal job. In the Burning Glass Institute (2018c) data provided, this job title ranked 12th in terms of demand from 539 job postings. Although no mention of skills specific to the use of Azure or web framework, data was shown that ranked hypertext preprocessor/PHP skills at number 12 in the most demanded skills from employers (Burning Glass Institute, 2018a). Generally, IT experience ranked 73rd in the most demanded skills and leadership ranked 12th (Burning Glass Institute, 2018b).</p>
              <p>After analysing the data provided, Chris is still interested in a career as a Software Engineer but now also has an equal interest in a career as a Front End Developer. This is because Javascript ranked higher and from further research on Seek (n.d.,) Chris found there are 3835 job advertisements posted as of the access date. This indicated to Chris that the industry has a high need for the position of Front End Developer.</p>

              <h3>Andy</h3>
              <p>Andy identified Data Warehouse Manager as his ideal job. Within the Burning Glass data, this job title does not appear, however ‘Data Warehouse Developer’ does. This job is not highly ranked at #192 (2018c), however could be an entry level into a data warehouse environment.</p>
              <p>Andy’s in-demand skills do not have Azure specifically referenced however skills such as ASP (30) is a framework to work with Azure. Linux is listed as the 10th most in demand with the top IT skills which are not in the required skill being SQL 1st, Javascript 2nd and Java 4th. Review of the Burning Glass data made Andy realise this is not a highly sought-after role. This doesn’t change the appeal of the job, however, it does focus Andy's attention on other career opportunities through IT management.</p>
