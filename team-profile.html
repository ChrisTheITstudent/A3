          <h2>Christopher</h2>
          <p>Chris’s results reveal him as a protagonist. The highest scores were for the feeling and extroverted categories. When Christopher took the Educational Planner Learning Test, his highest result (55%) showed that he is a tactile learner. This means that the easiest way for Christopher to learn something is by doing it. The results from the Favourite Types of Work test that Christopher took showed a result that favours investigative work. </p>

        <div class="personality per-jen">
          <h2>Jennifer</h2>
          <p>Jennifer is introverted though assertive, efficient, and practical. The results also show that she values order and prefers to work alone. The test also assessed Jennifer as ‘feeling’ in nature, meaning she is empathetic and prioritises cooperation. Jennifer is assessed as having a ‘gold’ personality. Jennifer is dependable, prepared, organised, and caring. The results also show she believes there is always a right and wrong way to do things and that she is a rule-follower. The PLP profile summary pointed out Jennifer’s strengths align to academic drive and accessing support. Personal value was also highlighted as a focus area.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="personality per-andy">
          <h2>Andy</h2>
          <p>Andy displays qualities of kindness and is a true altruist. The results showed Andy has strength in humility which should support working in a team. Andy was given a label of extroversion which indicates outgoing and social. The second factor supported emotion stability. Andy was given a reflector style match which interestingly is a ‘stand back’ approach and in contradiction to the outgoing social nature of test 2.</p>

          <h2>What does this mean for Team Focus?</h2>
          <p>The personality profiles show a few commonalities. For the Myers-Briggs test, Andy and Jen are both assessed as Defenders, within the Sentinel personality  group, with Chris a Protagonist within the Diplomat group.   All three  personality types share characteristics of enthusiasm and are hardworking, with deadlines likely to be achieved. All three team members are also thoughtful and caring.</p>
          <p>The main differences are evident for learning style, with Chris a tactile learner, Jen preferring to work independently and Andy preferring to analyse data first. </p>
