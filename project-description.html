              <h3>Front-End Developer</h3>
              <p>Andy has taken on the role of front end developer within the project. Care focus called for a UI that was easy to understand, inviting and functional. This lead to the team discussing Andy's use of skills to develop a front end for the application. Through these skills, the team descided that <em>Power Apps</em> would be ideal to design a prototype with. Using Andy's experience and skills within this tool, the application began having the interface that met the aims of the project.</p>

                <p>Entry: Tonight, we had an informal meeting and gathered a few ideas together. The team quickly developed a plan of action as to the steps to take to design the project idea. This was great as it left us plenty of time to consider other aspects of the project management such as delegation, time management and briefly on the group process. We took turns in discussing our strengths and weaknesses as well as the strengths we saw in the rest of the group. Andy, with his knowledge and skills in teams suggested there was a way in which we can use teams to make a simple application given the teams skill level regarding programming. Jennifer explained the work she had already been doing regarding the reports and the information we could use again from previous projects and the points that she has been considering using her project management skills.</p>
                <p>I also discussed the aspects that I had been considering from reading the rubric and began noting in Wrike the steps we may need to take and the timeline.</p>

                <p>Entry: I was tasked to do some research regarding existing like applications.  I included a reference to the existing online calculator provided by ACECQA as it frequently comes up on Google search.  I also found a list of registered childcare subsidy software through the Department of Education’s website.  I reviewed each product listed for comparison. I have outlined the points of difference (where I could identify them) in comparison to the project proposal and provided links/references within the document.</p>
                <p>I also updated my outstanding tasks, noting that career plans and the project idea headings are already contained within the main document. Our team needs to decide if we have one overall document or one for each section.  I have added this to Thursday’s agenda and noted that the job advertisement task assigned to me is blocked until we decide on the tools and technologies we will use to build the product.</p>

                <p>Entry: Today I have drafted the Tools component of the report, completed the personality profile comparison - this needed to be revisited given our profile has changed, drafted the Ideal Jobs and Career Plans comparison/reflection, updated the reference list to include additional research completed, and published all new content in Canva.  </p>
                <p>I also named the team and posted an announcement on Canvas, closing off these tasks in Wrike.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon I started reviewing the Assignment 5 requirements in Canvas and realised a draft storyboard and script was due the nighe before.  I contacted the team through Teams chat. Chris emailed Anthony to check whether the due date had been extended.  He had already developed a draft storyboard, so we worked together to draft a script for submission.</p>

              <p>Entry: Today I continued work that I began on the website. This will form part of the marketing for the application. At our meeting, we discussed finding 2 people each to test the application once the prototype gets the ok from each team member. One person we choose will know a bit about technology and one person will know nothing about technology. The team felt that this would give us a better understanding of how easy the application is to use.</p>

                <p>Entry: I was tasked with designing a flow chat type design to explain how the ratio formulas would work within a database. After researching through ACEQA (n.d.-b), it was found that there would be a need for different ratios based on different states. To begin with I decided to focus on the ratios in QLD as they would be implemented in the majority of states. I then used teams to create a flowchart in a tab that the team could view and we would be able to refer to at later points. In future, ratios would be able to be changed based on the different states.</p>
                <p>Another barrier I discovered while developing the database chart is tracking changes in legislation. At this stage this appears it would need to be updated and release versions would need to be updated when changes occur. Information in the application regarding the latest review of the ratios would be beneficial in helping educators ensure the app is using the latest legislation framework.</p>

                <p>Entry: I removed the technology reports from the last assignment as they are no longer required and copied over the remaining content needed from Assignment 2 to both the website and the report document.  Andy has reviewed the comparison software I identified and compiled the information found into a quick reference table. The calculator will be used to test our application and ensure the calculations are correct.</p>
                <p>I signed up for Canva and developed a protoype report template, as the examples shown appeared much more professional than our past submission.</p>
                <p>Now that we have confirmed we will progress with app development through PowerApps, I have drafted a job advertisement for a PowerApps Developer.  I have also updated the Agenda for tomorrow night to agree on the other 3 roles required.</p>

                  <p>Date: 08 August 2022</p>
                  <p>Entry: Today I explored the app development further. I learnt how to use power apps through various online sites including the official Microsoft site and YouTube. This helped me gather the skills and knowledge I needed to begin the front-end development. I began put together a prototype application using power apps that we would be able to use for testing to gather userablility feedback. At this point I focused on the family interface. Families are now able to create an account, log in and see the children they have in the system. I have created a database for the login details, families and for Educators. I plan to make a database that admin users are able to login to edit anything they wish.</p>

                  <p>Entry: Today I began by finalizing the interface for families. Families are now able to login and sign their children in and out of the application and began work on the educator interface. The educators can now see the children and ages in the services that are attending. They can also see what age group they are arranged into.</p>

                <p>The scope of the project is to develop the Care Focus application interface and databases associated with the use of the application. Within this scope, the research and learning of software used to develop the application will be required to design a prototype. While the user interface is being designed, a database that’s sharable within the team would need to be developed and a way for the application to write, edit and read from the database would need to be considered. Another factor within the scope is developing an administration interface which will enable management to observe the application data and edit as they see needed.</p>
                <p>The final addition to the scope will include a calculation formula that the application uses to display ratios and required educators for staff. Limitations of the project would be the time it takes to learn the skills for developing the application, the current skills the team shares, software compatibility within the database and UI and access to testing methods. Another limitation of the project would be bug and the fixes required after each testing phase before the application can proceed to the next testing phase.</p>

                  <p>Testing of the application initially was on an individual basis. As the team developed aspects of the application, the updated versions were made accessible to the rest of the team to explore. This resulted in some bug fixes and issues that arose regarding the accessibility of the databases both for team members and for the application itself. The second stage of testing was a group test within a meeting. This test showed that the databases required a rework before any further testing was completed.</p>
                  <p>In the future, plans for testing will include testing within a target audience which would include education professionals and parents. The target audience would ideally have a mix of both limited and moderate technical knowledge. The next testing phase is planned to be an alpha release to a early childhood education service in which the application is implemented and tested in a real world environment. After each of these phases are passed, a beta testing phase is planned in which the application is rolled out amongst several services and customer support is offered as the participant’s use and reactions are monitored. The final stage is the first release test. In this stage the application is released to the public and feedback is received. Customer support and monitoring would still be highly regarded at this stage. The final stage is planned to be evaluated and reviewed regularly.</p>
