          <h2>Aim</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="aim-description">
          <p><strong>"To produce a safe application which educators in the early childhood education sector are able to easily use in order to check the current staff to child ratio."</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="aim-explaination">
          <p>The application aims to be easy to use so it requires little to no training. The aim of the project is to be able to provide this to educators across the field so the application should be free or very low cost. By storing, creating, updating and reading entries within a database, the application will calculate the appropriate child to staff ratios and return the minimum staff required and the age groups the children are grouped into.</p>

          <h2>Steps and Goals</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="goals-list">
          <ul class="goals">
            <li>&#11162; Create a static application</li>
            <p>The first goal would be to design, create and appraise a static application. This could be a website which will be planned to be turned into a dynamic stie for a web application, static application which could be used on a smart device with plans to be turned into a dynamic application.</p>
            <li>&#11162; Create an accessible database</li>
            <p>In this goal, a way to store information is designed, created and appraised. This database will need to include at MINIMUM; number of children in attendance, ages of children in attendance and number of educators. This database then would be required to be accessible to add, view and modify entries of the data stored.</p>
            <li>&#11162; Research market demand and competition</li>
            <p>At this stage, the team plans to research market competition and market demand. The team will research what is already available on the market to solve the problems that the application plans to resolve. During this process, the team foresees that current barriers within the market may become evident for the team to consider.</p>
            <li>&#11162; Design, make and appraise security and confidentiality protocols</li>
            <p>A security protocol will need to be designed, made and appraised. This would be required in order for the application to be viable to services that would need to meet privacy legislation regarding the storage of information about children and families. This would be an important part to be transparent about in the release of the application as services and families would want to know when, where and how their information is being protected.</p>
            <li>&#11162; Database and web/smart device application integration</li>
            <p>This goal is when the static database and static web/smart device application or applications become integrated. This would involve deciding the easiest, most efficient and secure way that the application can access the database independently of the user.</p>
            <li>&#11162; Prototype developed</li>
            <p>This is the point that the team plans to attempt to make a prototype of the application. Depending on if the team first 	develops a web application before developing further applications, this could involve creating a prototype website for the application along with the database and security protocols. Once the protocol is developed, a test will be run. This could possibly be done within a test group service or within a test group. The purpose of the prototype testing would be to identify bugs and evaluate the prototype against the aim of the project.</p>
